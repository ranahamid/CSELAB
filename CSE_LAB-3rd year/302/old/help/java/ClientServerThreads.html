 socket is the one end-point of a two-way communication link between two
 programs running over the network. Running over the network means that 
the programs run on different computer. However one can run these two 
programs on the same computer. These two communicating programs form a 
Client/Server application.<p>In Client/Server applications the server 
normally listens to a specific port waiting for connection requests from
 a client. When a connection request arrives, the client and the server 
establish a dedicated connection to communicate. During the connection 
process, the client is assigned a local port number, and binds a socket 
to it. The client talks to the server by writing to the socket and gets 
information from the server by reading from it. Similarly, the server 
gets a new local port number to communicate with the client. The server 
also binds a socket to its local port and communicates with the client 
by reading from and writing to it. The server uses a specific port 
dedicated only to listening for connection requests from other clients. 
It can not use this specific port for communication with the clients.</p><p>The
 client and the server must agree on a protocol. They must agree on the 
language of the information transferred back and forth through the 
socket.</p><p>The java.net package in the Java development environment provides the class <tt>Socket</tt> which implements the client side and the class <tt>ServerSocket</tt> class which implements the server side of the two-way link.</p><p>There 3 types of sockets:</p><ul><li>Stream socket (to listen for client requests): the class ServerSocket. </li><li>Stream socket: the class Socket. </li><li>Datagram socket: the class DatagramSocket.</li></ul>There are two communication protocols that one can use for socket programming: stream communication and datagram communication.<p>The
 stream communication protocol is known as TCP (transfer control 
protocol). TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. In order to 
communicate over the TCP protocol, a connection must first be 
established between two sockets. While one of the sockets listens for a 
connection request (server), the other asks for a connection (client). 
Once two sockets have been connected, they can be used to transmit data 
in both (or either one of the) directions.</p><p>The datagram 
communication protocol, known as UDP (user datagram protocol), is a 
connectionless protocol, meaning that each time a datagram is sent, the 
local socket descriptor and the receiving socket's address must be also 
sent in the same datagram. Thus, additional data must be sent each time a
 communication is established.</p><p>UDP is an unreliable protocol, 
there is no guarantee that datagrams will be received in the same order 
by the receiving socket. On the other hand, TCP is a reliable protocol; 
it is guaranteed that the packets will be received in the order in which
 they were sent.</p><p>TCP is useful for implementing network services, 
which require data of indefinite length to be transferred. UDP is less 
complex and is often used in implementing client/server applications in 
distributed systems running over local area networks.</p><p>This article shows how to program sockets in Java using the TCP/IP protocol.</p><h3>Opening a socket</h3>When programming a client, a socket must be opened like this:<pre> Socket MyClient;
 MyClient = new Socket("Machine name", PortNumber);
</pre>or using the exception handling,<pre> Socket MyClient;
 try {
       MyClient = new Socket("Machine name", PortNumber);
     }
     catch (IOException e) {
       System.out.println(e);
     }
</pre>Where Machine name is the machine to open a connection to, and 
PortNumber is the port (a number) on which the server to connect to is 
running. When selecting a port number, one has to know that the port 
numbers in the range from 0 to 1023 are reserved for standard services, 
such as email, FTP, HTTP, etc.<p>When programming a server, a server 
socket must be opened first. The server socket is dedicated to listen 
for and accept connections from clients.</p><pre> ServerSocket MyService;
 try {
       MyServerice = new ServerSocket(PortNumber);
     }
     catch (IOException e) {
       System.out.println(e);
     }
</pre>When implementing a server one also needs to create a client socket to communicate (send/receive data) with the client programs.<pre> Socket clientSocket = null;
 try {
       serviceSocket = MyService.accept();
     }
     catch (IOException e) {
       System.out.println(e);
     }
</pre><h3>Creating an input stream</h3>On the client side, you can use the DataInputStream class to create an input stream to receive response from the server:<pre> DataInputStream input;
 try {
    input = new DataInputStream(MyClient.getInputStream());
 }
 catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println(e);
 }
</pre>The class DataInputStream allows you to read lines of text and 
Java primitive data types in a portable way. It has several read methods
 such as read, readChar, readInt, readDouble, and readLine. One has to 
use whichever function depending on the type of data to receive from the
 server.<p>On the server side, the DataInputStream is used to receive input from the client:</p><pre> DataInputStream input;
 try {
      input = new DataInputStream(serviceSocket.getInputStream());
 }
 catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println(e);
 }
</pre><h3>Create an output stream</h3>On the client side, an output 
stream must be created to send teh data to the server socket using the 
class PrintStream or DataOutputStream of java.io package:<pre> PrintStream output;
 try {
    output = new PrintStream(MyClient.getOutputStream());
 }
 catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println(e);
 }
</pre>The class PrintStream implements the methods for displaying Java 
primitive data types values, like write and println methods. Also, one 
may want to use the DataOutputStream:<pre> DataOutputStream output;
 try {
    output = new DataOutputStream(MyClient.getOutputStream());
 }
 catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println(e);
 }
</pre>The class DataOutputStream allows to write Java primitive data 
types; many of its methods write a single Java primitive type to the 
output stream.<p>On the server side, one can use the class PrintStream to send data to the client.</p><pre> PrintStream output;
 try {
    output = new PrintStream(serviceSocket.getOutputStream());
 }
 catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println(e);
 }
</pre><h3>Closing sockets</h3>The output and input streams must be closed before the socket is closed. On the client side:<pre> try {
    output.close();
    input.close();
    MyClient.close();
 } 
 catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println(e);
 }
</pre>On the server side:<pre> try {
    output.close();
    input.close();
    serviceSocket.close();
    MyService.close();
 } 
 catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println(e);
 }
</pre><h2>A simple Client/Server example</h2><h3>The client</h3>This is a
 simple client which reads a line from the standard input and sends it 
to the echo server. It keeps then reading from the socket till it 
receives the message "Ok" from the server. Once it receives the "Ok" 
message then it breaks.<pre>//Example 23

import java.net.*;

public class client {

// once we received that then we want to break.

                String responseLine;
                os.println(inputLine.readLine()); 
                while ((responseLine = is.readLine()) != null) {
                    System.out.println(responseLine);
                    if (responseLine.indexOf("Ok") != -1) {
			break;

</pre><h3>The server</h3>This is a simple echo server. As long as it 
receives data it echos that data back to the client appending it to the 
"From server :" string.<pre>//Example 24

        Socket clientSocket = null;
           
// Try to open a server socket on port 2222
// Note that we can't choose a port less than 1023 if we are not
// privileged users (root)

        try {
           echoServer = new ServerSocket(2222);
        }
        catch (IOException e) {
           System.out.println(e);
        }   

// Create a socket object from the ServerSocket to listen and accept 
// connections.
// Open input and output streams

        try {
           clientSocket = echoServer.accept();
           is = new DataInputStream(clientSocket.getInputStream());
           os = new PrintStream(clientSocket.getOutputStream());

// As long as we receive data, echo that data back to the client.

</pre><h2>A multithreaded Client/Server example</h2>This is a 
multithreaded chat application. The client uses two threads to interact 
with the server and with the standard input. The server uses a separate 
thread for every client. It spawns a new client thread every time a new 
connection from a client is established.<h3>The chat client</h3>This is

ServerSocket classes) allow to implement Client/Server applications and 
provide a powerful and flexible infrastructure for network programming. 
Other network programming classes can be also used. For example, 
URLConnection class is probably more suitable for some applications. 
URLConnection class provides a higher lever interface for network 
programming where the sockets are part of the underlying implementation.<h2>Exercises</h2><ol><li>Study and try all the examples presented above. </li><li>Modify the multithreaded chat program so that the server could accept an unlimited number of clients.</li></ol><h2>Useful links and credits:</h2><ol><li><a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-1996/jw-12-sockets.html">Sockets programming in Java: A tutorial</a></li></ol><hr width="100%"><em>Last Revised: </em><br><hr width="100%"><b><a href="http://www.ase.md/%7Eaursu/Concurrent_Programming_en.html">Back to Concurrent Programming Page</a></b> <script language="javascript"><!--
