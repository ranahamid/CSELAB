First you need the space a single animal occupies at an average. 
This value (in square meters) is then multiplied by the parameter
 that stands for the farmer's environment-friendliness, resulting 
in the premium a farmer is paid per animal he owns. To compute the
 final premium of a farmer just multiply this premium per animal with 
the number of animals the farmer owns.

Problem said " We won't make a difference between different

animals, although this is far from reality". So You have only calculate

( size of farmyard * environment-friendliness). And sum of total

value is answer. Confirm it yourself. ^^
