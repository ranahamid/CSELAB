<a NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000"></a><font color="#0070E8">The Problem</font></h2>
The Joseph’s problem is notoriously known. For those who are not familiar
with the problem, among n people numbered 1,2…n, standing in circle every
mth is going to be executed and only the life of the last remaining person
will be saved. Joseph was smart enough to choose the position of the last
remaining person, thus saving his life to give the message about the incident.
<p>Although many good programmers have been saved since Joseph spread out
this information, Joseph’s Cousin introduced a new variant of the malignant
game. This insane character is known for its barbarian ideas and wishes
to clean up the world from silly programmers. We had to infiltrate some
the agents of the ACM in order to know the process in this new mortal game.
<p>In order to save yourself from this evil practice, you must develop
a tool capable of predicting which person will be saved.
<p><b>The Destructive Process</b>
<p>&nbsp;The persons are eliminated in a very peculiar order; m is a dynamical
variable, which each time takes a different value corresponding to the
prime numbers’ succession (2,3,5,7…). So in order to kill the ith person,
Joseph’s cousin counts up to the ith prime.
<p><b>NOTE:</b> This problem may have a runtime of up to 4 minutes.
